## Hi, This is Lachi

I'm a 17-year-old full-stack developer. I was homeschooled, focusing just on programming and IT. I started coding at the age of 14–15. From the start, I was very interested in IT, so I jumped straight into programming, learning through online courses and building full-stack web applications on my own. I handled everything from backend systems to interface design and have built 10+ projects.

I love learning, solving complex problems, and creating my own projects. I've worked with TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, and other languages. I enjoy using modern web frameworks to build complete front-end and back-end applications.

Some of the recent projects I've worked on includes an e-commerce platform, a CRM, a social media app with JWT authentication and real-time features, an AI-powered PDF analyzer for teachers and students, a real-time chat app, a blog platform, a CMS, a job board, a linktree-style system with referral features, and a food business platform with automated invoicing and integrations!

Working and building projects is how I learn best and have been learning, It really helps me think critically and improves problem-solving skill. I'm really excited about using AI, to improve my projects and automate tasks efficiently.
